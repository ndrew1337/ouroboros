"""S30–S31 — the exact mid-run budget pause and its owner-granted same-id Resume
(#1196), as a REAL consumer of the candidate (wave 8): the MANAGED root (S30) and
the DIRECT owner-chat turn (S31).

Owner Q1–Q10 (#1196): a task that meets a monetary rail AFTER work has been done
no longer buys a wrap-up call and ends ``failed/budget_exhausted`` — it PAUSES
exactly at a completed boundary, nonterminal, under its own task id, and only an
explicit owner Resume (never a budget increase) continues it. The unit suites
(``tests/test_budget_pause_exact*.py``) pin every seam against stubbed contexts;
THIS scenario drives the whole path on a real isolated server: a pooled worker,
the supervisor's queue transition, the durable task-result authority, the queue
snapshot, the owner HTTP surfaces (``/api/state``, ``/api/settings``,
``/api/tasks/{id}/resume``) and the loopback model — keyless, with the money made
REAL by a stub that reports a provider-final cost on every call.

DETERMINISM. Exhaustion is a function of the call count, not of time: every stub
completion costs the same known amount, the wallet is a small multiple of it, and
the task's in-task graceful ceiling is disabled through its own contract
(``budget_profile.cost_hard_stop_pct = 0``) so the ONE rail that can fire is the
ledger's global dispatch fence (``usage_accounting.reserve_attempt`` →
``BudgetExceeded`` → ``loop_budget._handle_budget_exceeded`` → exact pause on the
``dispatch_refused`` rail). Every synchronization point is durable-event polling
over ``ArtifactOracle`` readers; the one NEGATIVE claim (a budget increase wakes
nobody) is a bounded watch for any wake signal, which must stay silent.

WHAT S30 ASSERTS, in order:
1. PAUSED, NONTERMINAL, SAME ID — after several priced tool-calling rounds the
   durable row carries a ``budget_pause`` projection in state ``paused`` (pause_id,
   pause_generation 1, a stored ``source_ref`` the tree's own reader opens, the
   rail, the exact-continuation facts, ``physical_calls`` ≥ 2, a ``boundary``
   resume point) on a row whose status is ``scheduled`` with
   ``reason_code=budget_paused`` — NOT a terminal; the queue snapshot holds the
   task as a PENDING carrier under ``_budget_pause`` (``paused_exact_continuation``,
   the checkpoint naming the same pause) and not in RUNNING; ``events.jsonl`` has
   the ``budget_scope_paused`` row (park_state ``paused``, worker_event source) and
   NO ``task_done`` for the id; ``/api/state.active_chat_activities`` reports the
   root as ``managed_task`` in phase ``budget_paused``; the worker made no paid
   wrap-up call after the pause decision (no ``[BUDGET LIMIT]`` prompt ever reached
   the stub, and the stub's call count is frozen from the pause on);
2. RESUME WHILE STILL EXHAUSTED is the typed 409 ``budget_still_exhausted`` with
   ``action=increase_budget_then_resume``: no grant on the durable row, the carrier
   untouched;
3. A BUDGET INCREASE ALONE WAKES NOTHING — ``POST /api/settings`` raises
   ``TOTAL_BUDGET`` (read back from the settings file the server owns), and a
   bounded watch sees no wake signal: the row stays ``paused`` without a grant, the
   carrier stays PENDING, no model call, no resume event, the activity phase stays
   ``budget_paused``;
4. EXPLICIT RESUME after the increase is the typed 2xx grant (``exact_continuation``,
   a ``grant_id``, generation 1, the paused interval carried separately); the
   durable row records the SINGLE-USE grant and the loop CONSUMES it (state
   ``resumed``, ``grant.consumed_at``), the resumed model round carries the host's
   continuation notice and the pre-pause transcript, the task completes under the
   SAME id with ``task_done`` exactly once, and the ledger-derived rounds and spend
   are cumulative (never reset: the pause-time numbers are a lower bound of the
   terminal ones);
5. a REPEATED resume on the completed task is the typed 404 ``task_not_pending``.

S30's PUBLIC status plane (``GET /api/tasks/{id}`` and the status-filtered list,
both served by ``task_status.load_effective_task_result``) is pinned by its OWN
test after the lifecycle proof, so a projection defect there is a named red
instead of a masked lifecycle: a paused root must not read as ``running``.

S31 drives the SAME lifecycle for the owner's DIRECT chat turn over the /ws the SPA
opens: no task contract disables its in-task graceful ceiling, so that (the other
rail family, ``graceful_ceiling``) is what fires; the live in-process actor ends
and the turn's own record is parked INLINE as the PENDING carrier with its
``_is_direct_chat`` lane fact; the census reports it as ``direct_chat`` /
``budget_paused``; the increase wakes nothing; the Resume grant carries the Q10
planning-threshold refresh, a POOLED worker continues the checkpoint (the resumed
round names the refreshed ceiling), and the turn concludes in the chat: the durable
chat row and the keyed final frame over the same socket, the activity gone.

The default-lane tests pin the literals the claims depend on (the paid wrap-up
prompt head, the resume notice, its Q10 branch) and the priced stub's wire shape
(a reported cost on both the JSON and SSE envelopes).
