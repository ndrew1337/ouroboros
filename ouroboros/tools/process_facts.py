"""Scoped process configuration and facts at the handler→loop boundary.

R5 (node-runtime sprint, stream B): the process-tool handler measures its child
directly (returncode, POSIX signal name, wall-clock duration, and — via the
stream-A resolver attestation — the physically resolved runtime) and publishes
the facts through a THREAD-LOCAL slot; ``loop_tool_execution`` consumes them
for the same tool call and merges them into the typed ``result_meta``.

Thread-local, not ctx-scoped, because the tool executor runs each handler in
its own worker thread — the slot is therefore naturally per-in-flight-call,
and an ABANDONED (outer-timeout) handler thread that finishes late writes only
its own thread's slot and can never contaminate a later call's facts. Selected Settings values stay in the scoped launch environment; diagnostics
are redacted before publication. Runtime provenance is also rendered in the
result. A record with no typed
publication carries no process facts at all — under the typed-result organ
(D02) prose is never harvested into typed fields.

This lives outside ``tools/shell.py`` deliberately: it is a loop↔handler seam
(``tools/verify.py`` consumes the attested runtime through it too), and keeping it here keeps
``shell.py`` under the repository's 1600-line hard size gate.
