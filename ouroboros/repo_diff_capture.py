"""One bytes capture of the acceptance repository diff, and its text projection.

The acceptance packet used to read the repository TWICE — once for the bounded
preview and once for the exact source — so the two views could describe two
different working trees, and both read git through ``text=True``, which raises
``UnicodeDecodeError`` on a text-classified file that is not UTF-8 (outside the
``SubprocessError``/``OSError`` guard, so the whole panel died). This module owns
the ONE capture both views project from:

* bytes, never a decoded stream, so a non-UTF-8 hunk cannot crash the capture;
* an explicit gap for every nonzero exit, timeout, unreadable repo and bounded
  cut — an unavailable diff is never projected as an empty (clean) tree;
* bounded memory and a bounded deadline: git writes to a private spool file
  (no pipe to deadlock on, a real subprocess timeout), only a bounded prefix of
  each section is held in memory, and a section past that ceiling keeps its
  FULL bytes on disk for the private retention instead of being thrown away.

The EXACT bytes stay private (``ouroboros.observability`` blobs: 0700/0600,
content-addressed, streamed, outside the actor-readable artifact store). What
reaches a reviewer, a log, an export or a download is the REDACTED text
projection: decoded and redacted in full BEFORE any presentation cut, so a
secret straddling a cut boundary can never leak half of itself.
