"""Passive skill→hub visibility and managed-task admission facts.

The passive skill index deliberately does not run Betterleaks, so it cannot claim
that the current bytes are publication-ready.  It does know whether the action is
visible and whether an ordinary managed task may start to repair/review/publish the
skill.  The selected-skill preflight owns the later scanner-backed readiness fact.

Imports only review vocabulary and the effective runtime policy — no skill loading
or gateway code — so it stays a thin predicate.
